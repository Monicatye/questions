## Why ?
Itâ€™s not easy to find answers to internal and technical questions inside a team project, as well as questions regarding internal process of the company.

## Sample problem we'd like to solve: 
 - Offer validated answers faster, within a centralized database.
 - Minimize the time users spent asking other people, or searching the answer of their question.
 
## Phase 1 / Free Hack Day - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on Nov 2015
Our first prototype is focused on showing suggestion of questions the user ask, and how to create a new question if the user couldn't find his question.  Answering questions is also a feature.

### Technology used to reach the goal
 - Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Profiling, Global Exception Handling)
 - Spring Data
 - PostgreSQL
 - Hibernate for entities managment
 - Freemarker in the UI
 - Apache Solr for suggestions

You can see the [prototype online](https://protected-refuge-1912.herokuapp.com/).

## Phase 2
It is pending but you could take a look to [issues](https://github.com/wdonet/nsquestions/issues)
